#  Assignment Title: Loop / Iteration Based Program




## Description:
This assignment is focused on the use of loops (iteration) in programming. It demonstrates how repetitive tasks can be automated efficiently using different types of loops such as for, while, or do-while.

The program was developed to fulfill a class assignment requirement and showcases my understanding of loop structures, logical conditions, and iteration control.


## ðŸ’¡ Key Concepts Used:
(I) Loops / Iteration:
Used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a specific condition is met. Implemented using for, while, or do-while loops.

(II) Conditional Statements:
Applied inside loops to control the flow of execution using if, else if, else conditions.

(III) User Input (if applicable):
Took input from users to dynamically control the number of loop iterations or decision-making.

(IV) Break and Continue (if used):
break is used to exit the loop early; continue is used to skip the current iteration.

(V) Nested Loops (if used):
Loops placed inside another loop to solve complex iteration problems like printing patterns.

(VI) Counters & Accumulators:
Variables used to count iterations or accumulate totals during looping.

(VII) Dry Run / Trace Table (if documented):
Manually traced loop behavior for testing and debugging logic flow.


## âœ¨Features:
âœ… Use of Loop Structures:
Efficiently demonstrates the use of for, while, or do-while loops to repeat operations.

âœ… Dynamic Input Handling:
Accepts user input to control loop behavior (e.g., number of iterations, conditions, etc.).

âœ… Clean and Readable Code:
Code is well-structured, properly indented, and easy to understand for beginners.

âœ… Condition-Based Execution:
Integrates if-else statements within loops to control logic and decision-making.

âœ… Pattern Printing / Calculation / Repetition Tasks (as applicable):
Performs tasks like pattern printing, number series generation, or repetitive calculations.

âœ… Output Display:
Displays results clearly in the console/output window for user understanding.

âœ… Basic Validation (if included):
Ensures that user input is within an acceptable range before processing.
## ðŸ””Purpose:
The main purpose of this assignment is to:

âœ… Understand and apply loop/iteration concepts in programming.

âœ… Learn how to automate repetitive tasks using different types of loops (for, while, do-while).

âœ… Develop problem-solving skills through logical thinking and condition-based iteration.

âœ… Practice writing efficient, readable, and maintainable code.

âœ… Gain hands-on experience with user input, decision making, and control structures within a loop
